# Stateful Functional Programming: A case-study in Pointer Gesture Recognition

[Slides](StatefulFP.pdf) for a talk on using functional programming techniques to tackle a stateful problem: gesture recognition of pointer events in the [gesture](https://github.com/benhutchison/gesture) library.

## Versions

Feb 2016: Talk given at Melbourne Scala meetup. Tended to emphasize "state monad" terminology.

Feb 2022: Revised talk given at Zendesk. With the benefit of 6 years more FP experience, broadened terminology to "Stateful Functional Programming", with state monad just a part of the overall approach.
